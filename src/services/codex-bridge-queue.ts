/**
 * Codex bridge fallback's pending-turn queue.
 *
 * Two operating modes via `setLocalTurns()`:
 *
 *   - **non-adopt** (default): worker owns the PTY and the only legitimate
 *     user input source is Lark. user_message events that don't match a
 *     pending fingerprint are history (resume / late-attach) and get
 *     silently dropped. Synthesising local turns here would replay
 *     yesterday's prompts to the Lark thread.
 *
 *   - **adopt**: Codex is the user's externally-running process; the user
 *     can type directly into the iTerm pane (or via Lark). Both should
 *     reach the Lark thread. user_message events that don't match a
 *     pending Lark fingerprint AND happen after `localLowerBoundMs - 5s`
 *     synthesise a local turn — formatted by the worker as
 *     "🖥️ 终端本地对话".
 *
 * Attribution rule:
 *   - mark()           — push a pending turn anchored to Lark fingerprint.
 *   - ingest(events)   —
 *       * 'user' event whose text matches the head pending turn's
 *         fingerprint → that turn becomes 'started' (collecting).
 *       * 'user' event with no match: dropped, OR (adopt-only) synthesised
 *         as a started local turn ahead of any unstarted Lark turn so
 *         emit ordering reflects when the event landed.
 *       * 'assistant_final' event → the currently-collecting turn closes
 *         with finalText set; eligible for emit on the next drain.
 *   - drainEmittable() — pop FIFO any leading turn that is started AND
 *     has finalText.
